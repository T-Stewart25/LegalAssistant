RE: VOSS, CHRISTOPHER
Date of Birth: 11/25/1984 (Age: 37)
Reason for Test: Estimate residual functional capacity
Dear Tom  Stewart:
This cover letter provides a brief summary of relevant data regarding Christopher Voss’s physical abilities that
were ascertained from the Functional Capacity Evaluation performed on 11/10/2022.
OVERALL PHYSICAL DEMAND LEVEL:
Light Work:
Mr. Voss is capable of assuming a position in a
LIGHT physical demand level
. Mr. Voss is capable
of exerting up to a maximum of 15 pounds of force occasionally throughout the workday with frequent lifting
or carrying objects weighing 8 pounds. However, in order for Mr. Voss to successfully work in a light physical
demand level, job factor restriction(s) must be met (see Table Summary page).
RELIABILITY AND CONSISTENCY OF EFFORT:
It  is  my  professional  opinion  that  Mr.  Voss  gave  a  consistent  performance  and  effort  during  his  functional
capacity evaluation. The results of this evaluation are a valid representation of his current functional abilities.
Signs  of  early  and  building  fatigue  with  compensation  in  standing,  leaning,  or  avoiding  squat  showed  Lower
Extremity limitations. Lift and exertion with Upper Extremity slowed and displayed a general reduced pace in
what presented as building fatigue with activity. The Coefficient of Variation Test and Dynamic Lift Heart Rate
Response Test were used to further determine consistency/validity of Mr. Voss’ test results/efforts (see Table
Summary page).
Comments:
Mr. Voss demonstrated symptoms provocation today consistent with diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis. Findings
of  this  test  suggest  that  Mr. Voss  would  have  some  disadvantages  in  a  physically  demanding  activity  or
sustained position tasks such as lift, carry, stand, sit, walk, crouch, or climb. This could limit his return to some
work  demands  that  require  activities  beyond  those  listed  in  this  report.  All  tests  today  consisted  of
standardized testing that challenged mobility, strength, endurance, sustainability, and validity in a variety of
settings. The outcomes  of  these tests suggested  that  Mr.  Voss could  move some  weight and  produce some
loaded  repetitive  motion,  but  with  increasing  combined  symptoms  and  over  compensation  that  should  be
considered  in  his  daily  performance  as  limiters.  These  determinations  are  based  on  test  physiological,
biomechanical,  safety,  and  psychophysical  endpoints,  the  individual’s  reported  symptoms  and  associated
behaviors,  clinical  examination  findings,  movement/performance  symptoms  and  associated  behaviors,  and
observed signs of associated pain or symptom provocation. Overall, I can state within a reasonable degree of
professional  certainty,  that  the  functional  limitations  mentioned  in  this  report  are  directly  related  to  his

CONSISTENCY OF EFFORT
It is my professional opinion that Mr
Voss gave a consistent performance and effort during this functional capacity evaluation. The results of this
evaluation are a valid representation of his current functional abilities Signs of early and building fatigue with compensation in standing, leaning, or
avoiding squat showed Lower Extremity limitations. Lift and exertion with Upper Extremity slowed and displayed a general reduced pace in what
presented as building fatigue with activity.

Test Date:

Start:
2:00 pm -
End:
4:00 pm;
Time:
2 hrs, 0 mins)
DIAGNOSIS
Multiple sclerosis (G35).
HISTORY OF CURRENT CONDITION
Early symptoms of MS Nov 2019 such as low back pain, R then L lower extremity numbness that was
moving  up  from  feet  to  spine.  These  early  symptoms  worsened  which  kept  him  from  driving  for  8
months. He  reported  a  number  of  times to  the ER  as symptoms worsened, but  covid  shut everything
down so he was left with minimal Techniques or treatments. He focused on diet, breathing exercises,
relaxation,  etc  as  his  options  were  limited.  March  2020  Dx  of  MS  was  confirmed  after  symptoms
increased in head and neck, balance, and gait were greatly affected (weakness, pain, and fatigue), then
followed  by  a  positive  MRI  showing  lesions  consistent  with  MS.  EMG  was  completed  for  both  upper
extremities  but  without  known  findings.  Treatment  consisted  of  chiro  care  in  the  past,  medical
marijuana for sleep, MS meds, infusions, pain medication.
Current  diagnosis  with  MS  specialist  with  Rocky  Mountain  Multiple  Sclerosis  Clinic  in  Salt  Lake  City  is
listed  as  Relapsing/Remitting  Multiple  Sclerosis,  Parathesias,  chronic  pain,  muscle  spasms,  and
weakness.
He  had  been  working  in  architecture  as  an  architect.  Work  is  demanding  as  an  Architect  with  limited
mental capacity and he cannot be limited by pain meds or other Tx that affect cognition. Limitation on
or  off  meds  caused  him  to  decide  between  symptoms  and  side  effects  or  work.  Unable  to  get  work
done when pain is high or during medication side effects, he has stopped working after trying reduced

INTRODUCTION
The above referenced individual participated in a Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) that is based on
the Dictionary of Occupational Titles-Residual Functional Capacity (DOT-RFC) Battery.

The Dictionary
of Occupational Titles (DOT) defines numerous job-related tasks and categorizes occupations into one
of  five  progressively  increasing  strength  classifications  (sedentary,  light,  medium,  heavy  and  very
heavy).
3,4
The  DOT-RFC  Battery  tests  over  30  different  job-related  tasks  (such  as  climbing,  balancing,  stooping,
crouching, crawling, walking, kneeling, etc.) that an individual may be required to perform for any given
occupation.  The  Battery  measures  an  individual’s  residual  functional  capacity  (performance  level
attained  for  each  job  related  task  tested)  based  on  peer  reviewed  norms  collectively  known  as  the
Demand  Minimum  Functional  Capacity  (DMFC).  The  DMFC  is  the  minimal  acceptable  level  of
performance for each job-related tasks or factors that a person must achieve before being able to safely
and dependably return to work.
The DOT-RFC Battery was created to measure the medical impairment of a person, express it in terms
of  functional  limitations,  and  ultimately  calculate  the  person’s  actual  work  capacity.

The  DOT-RFC
Battery was found to demonstrate: Excellent Face and Construct Validity, Good Test/Re-Test Reliability,
Good  Intra-Rater  Reliability,  and  Strong  Content  Validity.

Also,  some  DOT-RFC  Battery  job-related
tasks or factors have been shown to demonstrate predictive validity in the real work world.

FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY TEST RESULTS
Mr. Voss performed this Functional Capacity Evaluation in order to help determine his overall functional
capacities. Below is a detailed description of the actual performance levels achieved for each job factor
task completed.
PSYCHOSOCIAL &/OR PAIN ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRES
Quick DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand)
Description: The
QuickDASH
is a shortened version of the DASH Outcome Measure. Instead of 30 items,
the  QuickDASH  uses  11  items  to  measure  physical  function  and  symptoms  in  people  with  any  or
multiple musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb.  Like the DASH Outcome Measure the QuickDASH
also  has  two  optional  modules  intended  to  measure  symptoms  and  function  in  athletes,  performing
artists  and  other  workers  whose  jobs  require  a  high  degree  of  physical  performance.  These  optional
models  are  scored  separately.    The  QuickDASH  Outcome  measure  is  also  a  valid  and  reliable
questionnaire used for clinical and research purposes.
Test Results: Mr. Voss scored a
41%
overall disability rating on the QuickDASH questionnaire indicating
his upper extremity pain is limiting/restricting his functioning in activities of daily living (ADL). Mr. Voss
scored  a
56%
overall  disability  rating  on  the  QuickDASH  Work  module  questionnaire  indicating  upper
extremity  limitations/restrictions  in  his  abilities  to  function  at  work.  Mr.  Voss  scored  a
88%
overall
disability  rating  on  the  QuickDASH  Sports/Performing  Arts  module  questionnaire  indicating  upper
extremity  limitations/restrictions  in  his  abilities  to  function  during  sports  and/or  performing  arts
activities.
Lower Extremity Function Scale (LEFS)
Description: The Lower Extremity Function Scale (LEFS) is a self-reported outcome tool created to assess
lower  extremity  function.    The  LEFS  is  easy  to  administer,  is  applicable  to  a  wide  variety  of  lower
extremity  conditions  and  helps  the  clinician  to  establish  disability  levels,  set  functional  goals,  track
progress and measure patient outcomes.  The conceptual framework of the LEFS is based on the World
Health Organization’s model of disability and handicap and it was developed using a systematic process
of item selection and scaling.  The scale consists of 20 activities with each activity having four possible
choices  ranging  from  0  (extreme  difficulty  or  unable  to  perform  activity)  to  4  (no  difficulty).    Overall
patient  scores  range  from  0  percent  (no  functional  deficits  or  limitations)  to  100  percent  (complete
functional  deficits  or  limitations).  Test  and  re-test    reliability  was  demonstrated  to  be  excellent.
Construct  validity  was  established  by  comparing  the  Lower  Extremity  Function  Scale  with  the  SF-36
Health Survey.  The LEFS demonstrates a higher correlation between the "prognostic rating of change"
than  does  the  SF-36  physical  function  score  and  was  also  superior  to  the  SF-36  in  terms  of  "clinical
efficiency  and  sensitivity  to  change"  for  documenting  the  physical  capacity  of  patients  with  lower
extremity dysfunction.
Test Results: Mr. Voss scored a
59%
disability rating on the LEFS indicating that his lower extremity pain
is limiting/restricting  his functioning in activities of daily living (ADL).

SITTING, STANDING AND WALKING TOLERANCES
Sitting Tolerance Test
Objective: To assess sitting tolerances.
Materials: Stopwatch or timer, standardized chair.
Description:  The  subject  was  instructed  to  sit  continuously  in  a  standard  sized  chair  for  as  long  as
possible/tolerable  (maximum  of  30  minutes  without  knowledge  of  time  elapsed).  The  subject  is
required to meet the demand minimal functional capacity of 30 minutes.
Test Results: Mr. Voss was only
able
to
sit 25
minutes at one time.
Comments: Stands for relief from symptoms related to sustained upright seated position at just under
30 min
Standing Tolerance Test
Objective: To assess standing tolerances.
Materials: Stopwatch or timer.
Description:  The  subject  was  instructed  to  stand  continuously  for  as  long  as  possible/tolerable
(maximum  of  30  minutes  without  knowledge  of  time  elapsed).  The  subject  is  required  to  meet  the
demand minimal functional capacity of 30 minutes.
Test Results:  Mr. Voss was only
able
to
stand 10
minutes at one time.
Comments: Fatigue in legs early in material handling, needs to avoid knee bending to reduce buckling
Walking Tolerance Test
Objective: To assess walking tolerances.
Materials: Stopwatch or timer, treadmill or walking path.
Description:  The  subject  was  evaluated  by  having  him  walk  for  as  long  as  possible/tolerable  without
stopping (maximum of 30 minutes without knowledge of time elapsed) at a speed of no less than 2.0
mph  (3.2  kph).  The  subject's  blood  pressure  and  heart  rate  were  taken  prior  to  the  examination.  The
subject is required to meet the demand minimal functional capacity of 30 minutes.
Test Results: Mr. Voss was only
able
to
walk 8
minutes at one time.
Comments:  Walking  with  L  side  limp,  touching  TM  and  equipment  for  stability,  notes  instability  and
discomfort on TM because of instabilities, No R arm swing, focuses with forward gaze in order not to
loss balance or stumble with walking, talking to me during time on TM was distracting to his gait and
was seen to grab, hold, or brace for balance, he could not talk with ease and walk, increase neuropathy
in feet by 8 min walk (noted as building from feet to knees)
STRENGTH CAPACITIES
Combined Lift/Carry Test (manual materials-handling)
Objective: Determine the overall strength capacity for lifting and carrying. The protocol is a progressive
isoinertial test used to determine the maximum acceptable weight for lifting and carrying on a safe and
dependable basis up to 12 times per hour (i.e., occasional lifting).
Materials: Industrial Crate or Empty Box, free weights, an adjustable shelf that can hold over 100 lbs (45
kgs).
Description: The subject’s overall strength capacity was evaluated by having him lift a box from “floor to
waist”,  carry  the  box  with  both  arms  at  waist  level  for  14  feet  (4  meters),  lift  the  box  from  “waist  to
shoulder”, and return the box to the floor. This entire cycle is one repetition. First, the subject performs
this  task  using  an  empty  box/crate.  After  each  repetition,  1  to  5  pounds  or  kilograms  were  gradually
added  to  the  box  until  the  subject  reached  his  safe  one  rep  maximum  which  was  determined  by  the

Descrintion: The subject was evaluated by having him walk for as long as possible/tolerable without
stopping (maximum of 30 minutes without knowledge of time elapsed) at a speed of no less than 2.0
mph (3.2 kph):
The subject's blood pressure and heart rate were taken prior to the examination.
The
subject is required to meet the demand minimal functional capacity of 30 minutes.
Test Results: Mr. Voss was only able to walk 8 minutes at one time:
Comments: Walking with
L side
touching TM and equipment for stability, notes instability and
discomfort on TM because of instabilities, No R arm swing, focuses with forward gaze in order not to
loss balance or stumble with walking, talking to
me
during time on TM was distracting to his
and
was seen to grab, hold, or brace for balance, he could not talk with ease and walk, increase neuropathy
in feet by 8 min walk (noted as building from feet to knees)
STRENGTH CAPACITIES
Combined Lift/Carry Test (manual materials-handling)
Objective: Determine the overall strength capacity for lifting and carrying: The protocol is a progressive
isoinertial test used to determine the maximum acceptable weight for lifting and carrying on a safe and
dependable basis up to 12 times per hour (i.e,, occasional lifting).
Materials: Industrial Crate or Empty Box, free weights, an adjustable shelf that can hold over 100 Ibs (45
kgs):
Description: The subject's overall strength capacity was evaluated by having him lift a box from "floor to
waist" ,
carry the box with both arms at waist level for 14 feet (4 meters), lift the box from "waist to
shoulder" , and return the box to the floor. This entire cycle is one repetition. First, the subject performs
this task using an empty box/crate:
After each repetition, 1

rep maximum" was determined, the next goal was to determine what weight the subject can safely do
for 10 to 12 repetitions. This was accomplished by decreasing the one rep maximum weight by 10 to
20% and have the subject complete the task for an additional 10 to 12 repetitions.
Test Results: Mr. Voss was
able
to lift and carry up to
15
pounds. Therefore, he is capable of exerting up
to  15  pounds  of  force  occasionally,  and/or  up  to  8  pounds  of  force  frequently,  and/or  a  negligible
amount of force constantly to move objects. He may be able to lift greater weight but not in a safe and
dependable manner.
Comments: Good lift form in lift and carry, good pace through 12 reps at 20+ lbs, stands and pumps legs
and bends knees in recovery, braces over knees in flexed posture, crouching as well in recovery fashion,
notes  symptoms  mostly  noted  after  exertion  rather  than  current  activity,  building  fatigue  after  task,

Climbing Ladder Test
Objective: Assess the ladder climbing abilities and tolerances
Materials: 8-10 foot (2.5 to 3 meter) ladder.
Description: The subject’s ladder climbing capacity was evaluated by having him ascend and descend an
8-10 foot (2.5 to 3 meter) ladder (one repetition). The subject was instructed to climb up 6 ladder steps
before  descending.  Starting  and  ending  positions  were  standing  on  the  floor  in  front  of  the  ladder.
During the test, the individual performed the maximum number of repetitions possible (up and down
six ladder steps), until the point of voluntary fatigue. The subject must completely remove themselves
from the ladder before starting another repetition. A verbal command was given at the beginning of the
test, and during performance of the test, but no form of encouragement was given throughout the test.
The examiner records the number of repetitions completed during the test.
Termination Criteria: 1) Subject is unable to maintain balance up and down the ladder; 2) Subject is no
longer safe or able to perform; 3) Subject terminates the test; 4) Subject refuses to attempt the test
Test Results: Mr. Voss was
able
to ascend and descend a ladder 3 times.
Stooping Test
Objective: Gross assessment of stair stooping abilities.
Materials: Goniometer or inclinometer.
Description:  The  subject’s  stooping  ability  was  assessed  by  having  him  bend  forward  at  the  waist.  A
standard goniometer was used to measure the subject’s maximum trunk flexion. The subject is required
to meet the demand minimal functional capacity of stooping greater than 75 degrees.
Test Results: Mr. Voss was
able
to stoop greater than 75 degrees without difficulty.
Stooping - Dynamic (Repetitive) Forward Bending Test (Standardized Test)
Objective: A measure repetitive tolerance of forward bending and stooping.

movements  preceded  the  actual  test.  A  piece  of  tape  was  used  to  mark  the  target  distance  that  the
subjects were required to reach as they performed the timed repeated flexion test. After three warm
up trunk flexion movements, the range of lumbar flexion was measured in the standard manner, using
two  inclinometers,  one  placed  on  the  T12  and  the  other  on  the  S1  spinous  processes.  For  the  actual
test,  subjects  were  required  to  flex  to  the  limit  of  their  range  and  return  to  the  upright  position  as
quickly as tolerated. For this test, the described activity was repeated 10 times and the total procedure

before descending: Starting and ending positions were standing on the floor in front of the ladder.
During the test, the individual performed the maximum number of repetitions possible (up and down
six ladder steps), until the point of voluntary fatigue: The subject must completely remove themselves
from the ladder before starting another repetition. A verbal command was given at the beginning of the
test, and during performance of the test, but no form of encouragement was given throughout the test:
The examiner records the number of repetitions completed during the test:
Termination Criteria: 1) Subject is unable to maintain balance up and down the ladder; 2) Subject is no
longer safe or able to perform; 3) Subject terminates the test; 4) Subject refuses to attempt the test

The Purdue Pegboard Test (Standardized Test)
Objective: Assessment of fine motor unimanual dexterity and bimanual coordination.
Materials: Stopwatch or timer, Purdue Pegboard Test.
Description:  The  Purdue  Pegboard  is  a  test  of  unimanual  dexterity  and  bimanual  coordination.  The
Purdue Pegboard was developed in the 1940s as a test of manipulative dexterity for use in personnel
selection. The test involves two different abilities: movements of arms, hands, and fingers, & fine motor
extremity,  also  called  "fingerprint"  dexterity.  The  test  has  been  shown  to  be  reliable,  and  valid.  The
board consists of two parallel rows of 25 holes each. Pins (pegs) are located at the extreme right-hand
and left-hand cups at the top of the board. Collars and washers occupy the two middle cups. In the first
three subtests, the subject places as many pins as possible in the holes (first with the preferred hand,
then with the non-preferred hand, and finally with both hands) within a 30 second time period. To test
the right hand, the subject must insert as many pins as possible in the holes, starting at the top of the
right-hand row. The left-hand test uses the left row. Both hands then are used together to fill both rows
top to bottom. In the fourth subtest, the subject uses both hands alternately to construct "assemblies,"
which  consist  of  a  pin,  a  washer,  a  collar,  and  another  washer.  The  subject  must  complete  as  many
assemblies  as  possible  within  one  minute.  Scoring:  The  scores  for  the  pin  (peg)  placement  subtests
consist  of  the  number  of  pins  inserted  in  the  time  period  for  each  hand.  The  score  for  the  bimanual
condition  consists  of  the  total  number  of  pairs  of  pins  inserted.  The  assembly  score  refers  to  the
number  of  parts  assembled.  Test  scores  of  the  individual  (number  of  pins  and/or  assemblies)  are
compared to normative data, and higher scores indicate higher degrees of fine motor dexterity.
Test Results: Mr. Voss performed three trials per test area. The table below summarizes the results.

CARDIO-RESPIRATORY FITNESS
Single-Stage Treadmill Walking Test
Explanation: The Single-Stage  Treadmill Walking  Test is  classified as a submaximal  aerobic  fitness  test
that estimates VO2 max. This test is best suited for low risk, healthy, or non-athletic adults with low to
moderate fitness levels (ranging in age from 20 to 59 years old).  The slower walking pace used during
the test makes it suitable for subjects who experience pain when exercising at a jogging pace. The test
requires a treadmill and a heart rate monitor.  The walking speed for the test is individually determined
based on the participant’s gender, age, and fitness level.
Conclusions: The Single-Stage Treadmill Walking Test heart rate along with age, speed and gender, are
then  used  to  complete  an  equation  to  determine  the  subject’s  cardio  respiratory  (VO2  max)  fitness
level.
Raw Data: Resting heart rate = 65 bpm. Speed = 2.5 mph. Maximum heart rate = 70 bpm.
Test Results: The Single-Stage Treadmill Walking Test was used to estimate the subject’s VO2 max and
Cardio-respiratory fitness level. Mr. Voss’s estimated VO2max was
40.92
ml/kg/min placing him in the
Average Cardio-Respiratory Fitness Level
and a
45th

extremity, also called "fingerprint" dexterity. The test has been shown to be reliable, and valid:
The
board consists of two parallel rows of 25 holes each: Pins (pegs) are located at the extreme right-hand
and left-hand cups at the top of the board: Collars and washers occupy the two middle cups. In the first
three subtests, the subject places as many pins as possible in the holes (first with the preferred hand,
then with the non-preferred hand, and finally with both hands) within a 30 second time period: To test
the right hand, the subject must insert as many pins as possible in the holes, starting at the top of the
right-hand row. The left-hand test uses the left row. Both hands then are used together to fill both rows
top to bottom: In the fourth subtest, the subject uses both hands alternately to construct "assemblies,
which consist of a pin, a
washer, a collar, and another washer. The subject must complete as many
assemblies as possible within
one minute: Scoring: The scores for the pin (peg) placement subtests
consist of the number of pins inserted in the time period for each hand. The score for the bimanual
condition
consists of the total number of pairs of pins inserted:
The assembly
score refers to the
number of parts assembled:
Test
scores of the individual (number of pins and/or assemblies) are
compared to normative data, and higher scores indicate higher degrees of fine motor dexterity:

CARDIO-RESPIRATORY FITNESS
Single-Stage Treadmill Walking Test
Explanation: The Single-Stage Treadmill Walking Test is classified as a submaximal aerobic fitness test
that estimates VO2 max This test is best suited for low risk, healthy, or non-athletic adults with low to
moderate fitness levels (ranging in age from 20 to 59 years old):
The slower walking pace used during
the test makes it suitable for subjects who experience pain when exercising at a jogging pace: The test
requires a treadmill and a heart rate monitor.
The walking
for the test is individually determined
based on the participant's gender, age, and fitness level.
Conclusions: The Single-Stage Treadmill Walking Test heart rate along with age, speed and gender, are
then used to complete an equation to determine the subject' s cardio respiratory (VO2 max) fitness
level:
Raw Data: Resting heart rate = 65 bpm: Speed = 2.5 mph: Maximum heart rate = 70 bpm:
Test Results: The Single-Stage Treadmill Walking Test was used to estimate the subject's VO2 max and
Cardio-respiratory fitness level: Mr.
Voss's estimated VOZmax was 40.92 ml/kg/min placing him in the
Average Cardio-Respiratory Fitness Level and a 45th Percentile Rank:
Comments: Walking with
L side limp, touching TM and equipment for stability, notes instability and
discomfort on TM because of instabilities, No R arm swing, focuses with forward gaze in order not to
loss balance or stumble with walking, talking to me during time on TM was distracting to his gait and

CONSISTENCY OF EFFORT
Overall Examiner Observation
It  is  my  professional  opinion  that  Mr.  Voss  gave  a  consistent  performance  and  effort  during  this
functional  capacity  evaluation.  The  results  of  this  evaluation  are  a  valid  representation  of  his  current
functional  abilities.  Signs  of  early  and  building  fatigue  with  compensation  in  standing,  leaning,  or
avoiding squat showed Lower Extremity limitations. Lift and exertion with Upper Extremity slowed and
displayed a general reduced pace in what presented as building fatigue with activity.
The  Coefficient  of  Variation  Test  and  Dynamic  Lift  Heart  Rate  Response  Test  were  used  to  further
determine the consistency/validity of Mr. Voss’s  test results/efforts.
1.   Coefficient of Variation (CV) Grip Test
Explanation: The coefficient of variation (CV) is a measure of relative standard deviation.  The
CV  grip  test  analyzes  the  variation  of  strength  measurements  across  repeated  grip  strength
measurements.  The  CV  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  standard  deviation  of  the  grip  strength
measurements by the mean. A high CV is indicative of an inconsistent response from the subject
and  can  be  considered  to  be  the  result  of  a  submaximal  effort  by  the  subject.  Matheson  and
Ogden-Niemeyer  found  females  have  a  higher  variability  than  males  and  they  also
demonstrated that submaximal efforts usually produce greater variability than genuine efforts.
Conclusions:  The  greater  the  differences  from  trial  to  trial,  the  higher  the  coefficient  of
variance.  A  coefficient  of  variation  of  less  than  10%  for  males  and  12%  for  females  reflects
maximum  effort  during  the  test.    Pain  can  also  lead  to  increased  variable  results  making  the
differentiation between pain limitation and a submaximal effort to be a difficult one. Therefore,
the measurement of CV of an injured hand is not recommended when a determination of effort
consistency is the main objective.
Test Results: Right hand test scores are 95, 90, and 96 pounds. Left hand test scores are 102, 94,
and  86  pounds.  Mr.  Voss  scored  a  2.8%  CV  on  the  right  hand  suggesting  maximal  effort.  Mr.
Voss scored a 6.95% CV on the left hand suggesting maximal effort.
2.   Dynamic Lifts Heart Rate Response (DLHRR) Test
Explanation:  The  Dynamic  Lifts  Heart  Rate  Response  measures  two  different  aspects  of  a
subject’s  lifting  technique:  1)  safe  versus  unsafe  lifting  technique,  and  2)  maximal  versus
submaximal  effort.  This  test  measures  the  subject’s  heart  rate  response  during  safe-maximal
and submaximal efforts during a specific Functional Capacity lift task. The response to exercise
is an increase in heart rate with an increased effort (male and female heart responses are the
same regardless of fitness level).  Thus, the percent increase in heart rate from a safe-maximal
effort should be greater than the percent increase in heart rate from a submaximal effort.
Conclusions:  This  study  demonstrated  that  there  are  statistically  significant  differences  in
percent  change  in  pre-test  to  peak  heart  rate  between  safe-maximal  effort  and  submaximal
effort performance level groups for all three lift tests completed. Also, the minimum threshold
for heart rate changes expected for each lift task was established.  Statistically significant heart
rate response differences were also noted between gender and age.  The
lower
limit (total) for
all three lift tasks indicating that a safe-maximal effort was given ranged from 30.50% to 35.85%

No pain at all, you feel perfectly normal.
Very light barely noticeable pain, like a mosquito bite or a poison ivy itch. Most of the time you never think
about the pain.
Minor pain, like lightly pinching the fold of skin between the thumb and first finger with the other hand,
using the fingernails. People can react differently to this self-test.
Very noticeable pain, like an accidental cut, a blow to the nose causing a bloody nose, or a doctor giving you
an injection. The pain is not so strong that you cannot get used to it.
Strong, deep pain, like a minor trauma to part of the body. So strong you notice the pain all the time and
cannot completely adapt.
Strong, deep, piercing pain. Not only do you notice the pain all the time, you are now so preoccupied with
managing it that you normal lifestyle is curtailed. Temporary personality disorders are frequent.
Strong, deep, piercing pain so strong it seems to partially dominate your senses, causing you to think
somewhat unclearly. At this point you begin to have trouble holding a job or maintaining normal social
relationships.
Same as 6 except the pain completely dominates your senses, causing you to think unclearly about half the
time. At this point you are effectively disabled and frequently cannot live alone.
Pain so intense you can no longer think clearly at all, and have often undergone severe personality change if
the pain has been present for a long time. Suicide is frequently contemplated and sometimes tried.
Comparable to childbirth.
Pain so intense you cannot tolerate it and demand pain killers or surgery, no matter what the side effects or
risk. If this doesn't work, suicide is frequent since there is no more joy in life whatsoever.
Pain so intense you will go unconscious shortly. Most people have never experienced this level of pain.

BIOMECHANICAL (SAFETY)
Lifting  restrictions  imposed  by  the  treating  medical  practitioner,  or  other  healthcare  provider  or
occupation. Test termination by the clinician when the individual safely reaches the maximum required
weight load.
The test is terminated by the individual based on complaints of fatigue, excessive pain, and an inability
to complete the required number of movements during the testing interval (cycle). The evaluator needs
to  determine  if  the  individual  is  trying  his  or  her  best  and/or  if  there  are  other  extenuating  factors
limiting his or her performance.
Test  termination  by the  clinician  due  to  cardiovascular or  metabolic  changes.  This  end  point  relies  on
measurements of heart rate, oxygen consumption, or blood pressure. Examples: Heart rate outside of
the age-determined target heart rate, &/or a blood pressure >160/100 or > (10 mm Hg drop or increase
in diastolic pressure), &/or a 4% drop in O2 saturation a drop in o2 saturation <90%.
The test is terminated by the clinician if the individual’s technique (body mechanics) deteriorates during
testing  (he  or  she  demonstrates  unsafe  practices)  -or-  due  to  the  achievement  of  a  pre-determined
anthropometric safe lifting limit based on the individual’s adjusted body weight and/or based upon an
evaluation of the individual’s signs & symptoms.
