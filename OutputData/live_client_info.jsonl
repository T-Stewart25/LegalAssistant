He focused on diet, breathing exercises, relaxation, etc as his options were limited. March 2020 Dx of MS was confirmed after symptoms increased in head and neck, balance, and gait were greatly affected (weakness, pain, and fatigue), then followed by a positive MRI showing lesions consistent with MS.
