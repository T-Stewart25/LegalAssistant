Rice Place, Aurora, CO 80015; reason_for_visit: Estimate residual functional capacity; notes: Early symptoms of MS Nov 2019 such as low back pain, R then L lower extremity numbness that was moving up from feet to spine. These early symptoms worsened which kept him from driving for 8 months. He reported a number of times to the ER as symptoms worsened, but covid shut everything down so he was left with minimal Techniques or treatments. He focused on diet, breathing exercises, relaxation, etc as his options were limited. March 2020 Dx of MS was confirmed after symptoms increased in head and neck, balance, and gait were greatly affected (weakness, pain, and fatigue), then followed by a positive MRI showing lesions consistent with MS. EMG was completed for both upper extremities but without known findings. Treatment consisted of chiro care in the past, medical marijuana for sleep, MS meds, infusions, pain medication.

    "date: 11/10/2022; reason_for_visit: Functional Capacity Evaluation; notes: Mr. Voss was able to lift and carry up to 15 pounds. Therefore, he is capable of exerting up to 15 pounds of force occasionally, and/or up to 8 pounds of force frequently, and/or a negligible amount of force constantly to move objects. He may be able to lift greater weight but not in a safe and dependable manner. Comments: Good lift form in lift and carry, good pace through 12 reps at 20+ lbs, stands and pumps legs and bends knees in recovery, braces over knees in flexed posture, crouching as well in recovery fashion, notes symptoms mostly noted after exertion rather than current activity, building fatigue after task, HEART RATE: Pre HR = 90, Max HR = 130. BORG SCALE: Subject's rating of weight (RPE) = 13/20 (somewhat hard). END POINT: Unsafe/Overload body mechanics; so the adjusted recommended safe max weight was established (biomechanical). Mr. Voss was able to lift 20 pounds from floor to waist level. Mr. Voss may be able to lift greater weight but not in a safe and dependable manner.

    "date: 11/10/2022; reason_for_visit: Functional Capacity Evaluation; notes: Mr. Voss gave a consistent performance and effort during this functional capacity evaluation. The results of this evaluation are a valid representation of his current functional abilities. Signs of early and building fatigue with compensation in standing, leaning, or avoiding squat showed Lower Extremity limitations. Lift and exertion with Upper Extremity slowed and displayed a general reduced pace in what presented as building fatigue with activity. Coefficient of Variation (CV) Grip Test: Right hand test scores are 95, 90, and 96 pounds. Left hand test scores are 102, 94, and 86 pounds. Mr. Voss scored a 2.8% CV on the right hand suggesting maximal effort. Mr. Voss scored a 6.95% CV on the left hand suggesting maximal effort.
