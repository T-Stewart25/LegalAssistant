  "Mr. Voss was able to lift and carry up to 15 pounds. Therefore; he is capable of exerting up to 15 pounds of force occasionally; and/or up to 8 pounds of force frequently; and/or a negligible amount of force constantly to move objects. He may be able to lift greater weight but not in a safe and dependable manner. Comments: Good lift form in lift and carry; good pace through 12 reps at 20+ lbs; stands and pumps legs and bends knees in recovery; braces over knees in flexed posture; crouching as well in recovery fashion; notes symptoms mostly noted after exertion rather than current activity; building fatigue after task; HEART RATE: Pre HR = 90; Max HR = 130. BORG SCALE: Subject's rating of weight (RPE) = 13/20 (somewhat hard). END POINT: Unsafe/Overload body mechanics; so the adjusted recommended safe max weight was established (biomechanical). Mr. Voss was able to lift 20 pounds from floor to waist level. Mr. Voss may be able to lift greater weight but not in a safe and dependable manner. Comments: Fatigue noted after lifting and knees achy; good form in squat lift; building fatigue; crouch to get to heavier weight noted a leg give out sensation; long pause between lifts to recover in legs; HEART RATE: Max HR = 122. BORG SCALE: Subject's rating of weight (RPE) = 14/20 (somewhat hard to hard). END POINT: Unsafe/Overload body mechanics; so the adjusted recommended safe max weight was established (biomechanical).

  "Pulling Test: Mr. Voss was only able to pull 50 pounds and thus did not meet the demand minimal functional capacity of 80 pounds. Comments: The subject was limited by pain; decreased mobility and weakness. END POINT: Unsafe/Overload body mechanics; so the adjusted recommended safe max weight was established (biomechanical). Standing Balance Test: Mr. Voss was able to stand on a narrow beam for 30 seconds without difficulty. Comments: Shaky; sways some; but does not lose balance. Walking Balance Test: Mr. Voss was able to walk on a narrow beam for 6 feet (1.8 meters) without difficulty. Crouching Balance Test: Mr. Voss was able to crouch and balance himself on a narrow beam for 30 seconds but had difficulty with the task. Comments: L leg tremors and building fatigue within 30 sec; HEART RATE: Max HR = 103. BORG SCALE: Subject's rating of weight (RPE) = 16/20 (hard to very hard).
