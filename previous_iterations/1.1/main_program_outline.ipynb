    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook outlines a streamlined system for extracting structured client data from PDF documents, including scanned forms that may contain handwritten content. Each PDF is first converted to HTML, allowing for extraction of both embedded plain text and OCR output. These two sources are combined to ensure no critical information is lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the potential length and density of these documents, the text is divided into multiple chunks for processing. To improve throughput, the system uses Python‚Äôs `multiprocessing` module to launch two parallel API workers, each authenticated with a separate Mistral API key. The workers handle alternating chunks (even vs. odd), enabling efficient use of tokens and reduced runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each API response is logged and saved individually. After all responses are collected, each field in the schema is evaluated across the results, and the most frequently occurring value is selected as the final answer. These values are aggregated into a complete JSON object and saved as `final_consolidated_output.json`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support downstream applications and storage, the final results are used to generate structured SQL `INSERT` statements. These queries follow a normalized schema that mirrors the JSON structure and are automatically sent to a Supabase PostgreSQL database using Supabase's RESTful API. The system uses UUIDs to ensure consistent relationships across related tables (e.g., medical visits, work history) and supports case-insensitive field handling for robustness.\n"

    "In this section, I use Python to read input PDF files and convert each page into a high-resolution image. OCR is then applied to extract any readable text, including handwriting. At the same time, any embedded text from the PDF is extracted using HTML parsing. These two sources of information‚Äîstructured text and OCR‚Äîare combined into a single HTML document that preserves both the layout and full content of the original file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting HTML is saved to the `OutputData/` folder for further processing by the AI. The main function used for this step is `process_pdf_to_clean_html_and_text(pdf_path, output_html_path)`, which returns a plain-text version for inspection and writes the combined HTML document for downstream extraction.\n"

These early symptoms worsened which kept him from driving for 8 months. He reported a number of times to the ER as symptoms worsened, but covid shut everything down so he was left with minimal Techniques or treatments. He focused on diet, breathing exercises, relaxation, etc as his options were limited. March 2020 Dx of MS was confirmed after symptoms increased in head and neck, balance, and gait were greatly affected (weakness, pain, and fatigue), then followed by a positive MRI showing lesions consistent with MS. EMG was completed for both upper extremities but without known findings. Treatment consisted of chiro care in the past, medical marijuana for sleep, MS meds, infusions, pain medication.; Fatigue in legs early in material handling, needs to avoid knee bending to reduce buckling.

Fatigue noted after lifting and knees achy, good form in squat lift, building fatigue, crouch to get to heavier weight noted a leg give out sensation, long pause between lifts to recover in legs. Avoids bending legs to get weight, legs very fatigued, bends over flexing knees, upper body seems better then LE in task, able to lift upper body at 30 lbs. Good form and reach range of motion at increased weight, no sign of UE or LE changes. Fatigue in B LE cause sloppy walking and give out when setting down weight at 15 lbs, uses equipment to right himself to stand after carry, unsteady with increased weight.

It is my professional opinion that Mr. Voss gave a consistent performance and effort during this functional capacity evaluation. The results of this evaluation are a valid representation of his current functional abilities. Signs of early and building fatigue with compensation in standing, leaning, or avoiding squat showed Lower Extremity limitations. Lift and exertion with Upper Extremity slowed and displayed a general reduced pace in what presented as building fatigue with activity. The Coefficient of Variation Test and Dynamic Lift Heart Rate Response Test were used to further determine the consistency/validity of Mr. Voss‚Äôs test results/efforts.; Mr. Voss demonstrated symptoms provocation today consistent with diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis. Findings of this test suggest that Mr. Voss would have some disadvantages in a physically demanding activity or sustained position tasks such as lift, carry, stand, sit, walk, crouch, or climb. This could limit his return to some work demands that require activities beyond those listed in this report. All tests today consisted of standardized testing that challenged mobility, strength, endurance, sustainability, and validity in a variety of settings. The outcomes of these tests suggested that Mr. Voss could move some weight and produce some loaded repetitive motion, but with increasing combined symptoms and over compensation that should be considered in his daily performance as limiters.; Mr. Voss demonstrated symptoms provocation today consistent with diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis.

This could limit his return to some work demands that require activities beyond those listed in this report.

The outcomes of these tests suggested that Mr. Voss could move some weight and produce some loaded repetitive motion, but with increasing combined symptoms and over compensation that should be considered in his daily performance as limiters. These determinations are based on test physiological, biomechanical, safety, and psychophysical endpoints, the individual‚Äôs reported symptoms and associated behaviors, clinical examination findings, movement/performance symptoms and associated behaviors, and observed signs of associated pain or symptom provocation. Overall, I can state within a reasonable degree of professional certainty, that the functional limitations mentioned in this report are directly related to his diagnosis.; Mr. Voss performed this Functional Capacity Evaluation in order to help determine his overall functional capacities. Below is a detailed description of the actual performance levels achieved for each job factor task completed. Mr. Voss scored a 41% overall disability rating on the QuickDASH questionnaire indicating his upper extremity pain is limiting/restricting his functioning in activities of daily living (ADL). Mr. Voss scored a 56% overall disability rating on the QuickDASH Work module questionnaire indicating upper extremity limitations/restrictions in his abilities to function at work. Mr. Voss scored a 88% overall disability rating on the QuickDASH Sports/Performing Arts module questionnaire indicating upper extremity limitations/restrictions in his abilities to function during sports and/or performing arts activities. Mr. Voss scored a 59% disability rating on the LEFS indicating that his lower extremity pain is limiting/restricting his functioning in activities of daily living (ADL). Mr. Voss was only able to sit 25 minutes at one time. Stands for relief from symptoms related to sustained upright seated position at just under 30 min. Mr. Voss was only able to stand 10 minutes at one time. Fatigue in legs early in material handling, needs to avoid knee bending to reduce buckling. Mr. Voss was only able to walk 8 minutes at one time. Walking with L side limp, touching TM and equipment for stability, notes instability and discomfort on TM because of instabilities, No R arm swing, focuses with forward gaze in order not to lose balance or stumble with walking, talking to me during time on TM was distracting to his gait and was seen to grab, hold, or brace for balance, he could not talk with ease and walk, increase neuropathy in feet by 8 min walk (noted as building from feet to knees). Mr. Voss was able to lift and carry up to 15 pounds. Therefore, he is capable of exerting up to 15 pounds of force occasionally, and/or up to 8 pounds of force frequently, and/or a negligible amount of force constantly to move objects.

These early symptoms worsened which kept him from driving for 8 months. He reported a number of times to the ER as symptoms worsened, but covid shut everything down so he was left with minimal Techniques or treatments. He focused on diet, breathing exercises, relaxation, etc as his options were limited. March 2020 Dx of MS was confirmed after symptoms increased in head and neck, balance, and gait were greatly affected (weakness, pain, and fatigue), then followed by a positive MRI showing lesions consistent with MS. EMG was completed for both upper extremities but without known findings. Treatment consisted of chiro care in the past, medical marijuana for sleep, MS meds, infusions, pain medication.; Fatigue in legs early in material handling, needs to avoid knee bending to reduce buckling. Walking with L side limp, touching TM and equipment for stability, notes instability and discomfort on TM because of instabilities, No R arm swing, focuses with forward gaze in order not to lose balance or stumble with walking, talking to me during time on TM was distracting to his gait and was seen to grab, hold, or brace for balance, he could not talk with ease and walk, increase neuropathy in feet by 8 min walk (noted as building from feet to knees). Good lift form in lift and carry, good pace through 12 reps at 20+ lbs, stands and pumps legs and bends knees in recovery, braces over knees in flexed posture, crouching as well in recovery fashion, notes symptoms mostly noted after exertion rather than current activity, building fatigue after task. Fatigue noted after lifting and knees achy, good form in squat lift, building fatigue, crouch to get to heavier weight noted a leg give out sensation, long pause between lifts to recover in legs. Avoids bending legs to get weight, legs very fatigued, bends over flexing knees, upper body seems better then LE in task, able to lift upper body at 30 lbs. Good form and reach range of motion at increased weight, no sign of UE or LE changes. Fatigue in B LE cause sloppy walking and give out when setting down weight at 15 lbs, uses equipment to right himself to stand after carry, unsteady with increased weight. The subject was limited by pain, decreased mobility and weakness.; Functional Capacity Evaluation - Voss, Christopher - 11/10/2022 ... It is my professional opinion that Mr. Voss gave a consistent performance and effort during this functional capacity evaluation. The results of this evaluation are a valid representation of his current functional abilities. Signs of early and building fatigue with compensation in standing, leaning, or avoiding squat showed Lower Extremity limitations. Lift and exertion with Upper Extremity slowed and displayed a general reduced pace in what presented as building fatigue with activity. The Coefficient of Variation Test and Dynamic Lift Heart Rate Response Test were used to further determine the consistency/validity of Mr. Voss\\u2019s test results/efforts.; Mr. Voss demonstrated symptoms provocation today consistent with diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis. Findings of this test suggest that Mr. Voss would have some disadvantages in a physically demanding activity or sustained position tasks such as lift, carry, stand, sit, walk, crouch, or climb. This could limit his return to some work demands that require activities beyond those listed in this report. All tests today consisted of standardized testing that challenged mobility, strength, endurance, sustainability, and validity in a variety of settings. The outcomes of these tests suggested that Mr. Voss could move some weight and produce some loaded repetitive motion, but with increasing combined symptoms and over compensation that should be considered in his daily performance as limiters.; Mr. Voss demonstrated symptoms provocation today consistent with diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis.

The outcomes of these tests suggested that Mr. Voss could move some weight and produce some loaded repetitive motion, but with increasing combined symptoms and over compensation that should be considered in his daily performance as limiters. These determinations are based on test physiological, biomechanical, safety, and psychophysical endpoints, the individual\\u2019s reported symptoms and associated behaviors, clinical examination findings, movement/performance symptoms and associated behaviors, and observed signs of associated pain or symptom provocation. Overall, I can state within a reasonable degree of professional certainty, that the functional limitations mentioned in this report are directly related to his diagnosis.; Mr. Voss performed this Functional Capacity Evaluation in order to help determine his overall functional capacities. Below is a detailed description of the actual performance levels achieved for each job factor task completed. Mr. Voss scored a 41% overall disability rating on the QuickDASH questionnaire indicating his upper extremity pain is limiting/restricting his functioning in activities of daily living (ADL). Mr. Voss scored a 56% overall disability rating on the QuickDASH Work module questionnaire indicating upper extremity limitations/restrictions in his abilities to function at work. Mr. Voss scored a 88% overall disability rating on the QuickDASH Sports/Performing Arts module questionnaire indicating upper extremity limitations/restrictions in his abilities to function during sports and/or performing arts activities.
